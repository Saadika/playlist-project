Saadika Alard FNB Assessment

Good day,

Thank you so much for allowing me the opportunity to show you part of the skills that I have. 

Before running this project please ensure that you have Node.js install. On the file root please npm install http-server by doing:
npm i -g http-server

Once installed in the root of this project please run http-server in your terminal. Once running please navigate to localhost:8080 to view the results of this project.

Extra information:
I encorporated the necessary frameworks (Bootstrap and Bootstrap icons) I needed to put this project together by using minified reference versions. I also used something called TinyJpg for compressed images. You can rearrange the order of the songs using drag and drop.

Thanks again for this lovely opportunity and I hope you hear back from you soon.

Keep well,
Saadika Alard
